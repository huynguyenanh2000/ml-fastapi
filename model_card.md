# Model Card

## Model Details

- **Model Type**: Logistic Regression Classifier
- **Library**: Scikit-learn
- **Key Hyperparameter**: C (the regularization parameter)

## Intended Use

The primary use of this model is to predict if an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on specific features derived from the 1994 Census database.

## Training Data

- **Source**: The model was trained on the 1994 Census database curated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker from the Data Mining and Visualization division of Silicon Graphics.
  
- **Data Description**: The dataset contains attributes like age, workclass, education level, marital status, occupation, race, sex, hours worked per week, native country, capital gains and losses, etc.

- **Sample Data Point**:
```json
{
    "age": 36,
    "workclass": "Private",
    "fnlgt": 302146,
    "education": "HS-grad",
    "education_num": 9,
    "marital_status": "Divorced",
    "occupation": "Craft-repair",
    "relationship": "Husband",
    "race": "White",
    "sex": "Male",
    "capital_gain": 2000,
    "capital_loss": 0,
    "hours_per_week": 45,
    "native_country": "United-States"
}
```

## Evaluation Data

- **Description**: The evaluation data comprises 20% of the entire dataset. It was partitioned using the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn.

- **Metrics**:
  - **Precision**: 0.720226843100189
  - **Recall**: 0.26221610461114936
  - **Fbeta**: 0.384460141271443

## Ethical Considerations

The model has been trained on census data and is designed to be neutral, without introducing bias towards any specific group or demographic. However, users should always be cautious and ensure that predictions do not inadvertently lead to discriminatory practices or decisions.

## Caveats and Recommendations

1. **Bulk Predictions**: This model is more suited for batch predictions rather than real-time, on-the-fly predictions.
2. **Features Dependency**: The model's accuracy and reliability are highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the features from the Census database.
3. **Generalization**: Given that the data is from 1994, the model may not generalize well to contemporary socio-economic scenarios.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Consider the model's precision, recall, and Fbeta scores when weighing its utility for specific applications.

Users are encouraged to regularly retrain the model with more recent data and continually test its performance across diverse demographic groups to ensure fairness and accuracy.
